As a user of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) recently upgraded to WSL2. This repository brings together both configurations and downloaded plugins that make my productivity easier and faster.
Both images and documents of certain importance are also included.

**Warning:** For personal use 😶‍🌫️.

## What am I learning ✍🏾🕵🏾‍♂️
These are some subjects that I usually review to improve my productitivity and notion in programming.

- Better domain in the terminal without becoming an expert with [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/). Check my summaries of this website [here](./src/learn/linux-journey/linux-journey-introduction.md).

## My forms of organization and application

- Organizing files on the frontend  → 	recommendation of [Ghazi-Khan](https://github.com/gkhan205?tab=overview&from=2021-12-01&to=2021-12-31). For medium-sized application I make use of this organizational methodology the [cwg-react-starter](https://github.com/gkhan205/cwg-react-starter) for my projects in React.
